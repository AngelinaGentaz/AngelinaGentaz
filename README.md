Hi! My main project for the moment is working on the OECD AI Index, a project that aims to measure countriesâ€™ performance and progress towards trustworthy AI. Iâ€™m also a game theory lover and Iâ€™m keen to know more about computational social choice and also ML in general. Recently, I also started a quick personal project to explore how AI performance and capabilities trends can be indexed into current economics models of AI automation.

I mostly code in Python.
