Hi! Iâ€™m more a policymaker (AI policy) than a programmer but I love to dive into technical stuff from time to time and try to do different programming projects. My main project for the moment is working on the OECD AI Index, a project that aims to measure countriesâ€™ performance and progress towards trustworthy AI. Iâ€™m also a game theory lover and Iâ€™m keen to know more about computational social choice and also ML in general.

I mostly code in Python and can use Git.
